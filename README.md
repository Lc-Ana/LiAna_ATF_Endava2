**Sharing Test Context between Cucumber Steps**
> - share the Test Context with all the Step Definition files
> - proceed to Share Data by using Scenario Context in Cucumber
> - DataKeys class holds the test data information explicitly helping me store values in a key-value pair between the steps
> - it helps in organizing step definitions better rather than using private variables in step definition classes
